https://any-and-all.herokuapp.com/

Any And All is a B2C E-commerce online shopping site dealing directly from business to customer. Designed with an easy to use navigation to all pages with a search bar that can search any category or price or even key words in any product, making the site very accessible and easy to use for any level of user.

The user also has the option of signing up for a newsletter and checking out our Facebook page to stay up to date with all the latest deals and discounted products.
C.R.U.D functionality for users and staff..... 
- For users ~ They can write reviews, edit old reviews and delete them at any time and add things to they're wish list with the same edit, update and delete capabilities but they will need to register for this function.
- For staff ~ They can add, edit, update and delete items in the store with the correct authorization so the average user can not access these areas.
- For store owners ~ They can access the Admin with they're superuser authorization to remove any profanity written in reviews and control anything across the store like users, products, Emails Etc.
