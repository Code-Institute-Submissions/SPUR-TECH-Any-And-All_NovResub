# Any And All

### Live site:

https://any-and-all.herokuapp.com/

Any And All is a B2C E-commerce online shopping site dealing directly from business to customer. Designed with an easy to use navigation to all pages with a search bar that can search any category or price or even key words in any product, making the site very accessible and easy to use for any level of user.
The site consists of a sign up, sign in an sign out ability for ease of second visit saving customer details so check out will be super quick and easy with a secure payment system through Stripe payments so all user details are protected.
The user also has the option of signing up for a newsletter and checking out our Facebook page to stay up to date with all the latest deals and discounted products.
C.R.U.D functionality for users and staff..... 
- For users ~ They can write reviews, edit old reviews and delete them at any time and add things to their wish list with the same edit, update and delete capabilities but they will need to register for this function.
- For staff ~ They can add, edit, update and delete items in the store with the correct authorization so the average user can not access these areas.
- For store owners ~ They can access the Admin with their superuser authorization to remove any profanity written in reviews and control anything across the store like users, products, Emails Etc.

##  Screen shots of the site and it's responsive abilities:

As you can see it's fully responsive right across all devices and adapts to any screen sizes.

# Testing:

- I have manually tested every part of the functionality every step of the way.
- Each time I write a new line of HTML, CSS OR JAVASCRIPT I check to see if it looks how I expect it to look.
- With the HTML and CSS I targeted certain classes by adding a solid color background to be sure I'm targeting the right section then continue with the styling.
- With the JAVASCRIPT I write a small piece of code then console log the result to make sure the result is as I expected before continuing.
- I then tested the functionality of said code for instance if it's a button then that button must send the correct data and redirect the user to the relevant page.
- I made sure that if the user is authenticated then the log out will display in the NAVBAR and the relevant buttons are shown in the cart.
- I made sure that all buttons to delete item and any other buttons are removed in the success page.
- I deployed the site early so I could physically check the media query has been coded correctly to have the responsive ability required.
- I then ask friends and family to use the site with no instruction to see from a different perspective and ideas from real people for bug hunting and improvements.
- Tests were made to ensure the role based user could add, delete or update the menus, users  and comments in the admin page successfully.
- Tests were also made to ensure the user could add, delete or update their comments successfully and not access any other comments made by others.
- I tested the responsiveness through all screen sizes.
- Every page was put through the W3C HTML Validation checker and after working through all that was marked up in the code was where id's were repeating but the id's are needed so no changes were made and all is working correctly.
